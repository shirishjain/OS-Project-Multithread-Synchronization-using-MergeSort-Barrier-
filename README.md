# OS-Project-Multithread-Synchronization-using-MergeSort-Barrier-

 In this project, parallel algorithm is compared and analysed in relation to itâ€™s sequential counterpart. Through this, find the potential speedup for multithreading and what factors affects the performance. In addition, provide source code for multithreaded algorithms with proven time complexities
